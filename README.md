# PODRL

PODRL ("puddle") implements a version of reinforcement learning called deep Q-learning for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). It is a deep reinforcement learning framework for POMDPs. 

# Dependencies

The following Python packages are required to use PODRL.
* [Chainer](https://github.com/pfnet/chainer)
* NumPy

# Update
Porting everything over to Python. Hit various roadblocks with versatility of Mocha.jl-based deep learning. These issues are especially evident in the context of the reinforcement learning algorithm, which differs significantly from a traditional supervised learning approach drawing from a static dataset.
